    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Chicken:</b> This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your
        bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Seasonings:</b> This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt,
        black pepper, and onion powder.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Butter: </b> Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings
        something to adhere to.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Celery: </b>Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal
        flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken
        cooks.
